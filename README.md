# Biometric-Authentication
**ABSTRACT** 
With the rapid pace of technological growth, it is very important to secure user data. A robust technique that not only secures data but prevents it from various attacks is necessary. Such a technique is proposed in this article. Biometric authentication is one such practice seen today. In contrast to other forms of authentication, biometric recognition provides a strong link between a data record and an individual and it guarantees a high level of accuracy and security. But this biometric data can be used by attackers to get illegal access. A robust technique that not only secures data but prevents it from various attacks is necessary. Such a technique is proposed in this article. Biometric authentication (watermarking) is one such practice seen today. In contrast to other forms of authentication, biometric recognition provides a strong link between a data record and an individual and it guarantees a high level of accuracy and security. But this biometric data can be used by attackers to get illegal access. In order to prevent such acts, a robust technique known as zero-bit watermarking is proposed. The goal of this project is to identify someone who makes no mistakes, uses up less time, and avoids errors in small spaces. The process for fingerprint authentication divides identification into phases and gets rid of a lot of bogus prints at each phase. The high recognition rate of this results in significant time savings. Significant advancements in the industry demonstrate that for higher recognition, iris, and fingerprint biometrics still need quick, real-time, dependable, and strong algorithms.
**Existing System** 
There are several existing systems for biometric authentication of data, including fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, iris recognition, voice recognition, behavioral biometrics, and multimodal biometrics. These systems use a person's unique physical or behavioral characteristics to verify their identity, providing a more secure, convenient, and user-friendly method of authentication than traditional methods such as passwords or PINs. Biometric authentication can be integrated into a variety of devices and applications, including smartphones, laptops, and physical access control systems. Many organizations are adopting biometric authentication to improve security, increase convenience, and reduce the risk of data breaches. However, it is important to ensure that these systems are secure and protect the privacy of user data. By implementing biometric authentication, organizations can increase the security of their data and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. This method, is not so secure because different recognitions can be altered or forged, making the data vulnerable to attacks. Overall, there is a need for more reliable systems that enable users to effectively secure the data. 
**Problem Statement** 
The problem addressed in this report is the need for a more secure and reliable method of data authentication. Traditional methods of authentication, such as passwords and PINs, are vulnerable to hacking and fraud, leading to data breaches and security threats. To overcome these limitations, biometric authentication using iris and fingerprint data is a promising solution. However, there is a need to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and security of such a system and to identify the challenges and limitations of implementing it. This aims to explore the potential of using iris and fingerprint biometrics for authentication purposes, examine the existing systems, and propose a solution for secure authentication. It also highlights the advantages of using multimodal biometrics for authentication and discusses the potential applications of this technology in various industries. By addressing the problem of data authentication, this aims to provide insights into the benefits and challenges of using iris and fingerprint biometrics to enhance security and protect sensitive data. The data that is to be stored is encrypted and secured with the help of biometric authentication. This project's objective is to create and authenticate the users data that is precise, inexpensive, and available to a variety of users.

**CONCLUSION**
In conclusion, the use of biometric authentication systems, particularly those that combine iris and fingerprint recognition, offers a promising solution for secure and convenient authentication. The iris and fingerprint biometric system provides high accuracy, fast authentication times, reliability, usability, and security. Additionally, the system has several functional requirements, such as enrolment, integration, flexibility, scalability, security, user interface, monitoring, and maintenance. 
However, the potential for biometric data theft or breaches, and the need for standardization and interoperability. Nonetheless, the benefits of iris and fingerprint biometric authentication systems make them an attractive solution for various industries and applications, from healthcare to finance to law enforcement. As technology continues to evolve, the future of biometric authentication looks promising, and iris and fingerprint recognition systems will continue to play an essential role in securing our data and identity.
Moreover, the combination of iris and fingerprint biometric authentication with One-Time Password (OTP) provides an even more secure and reliable method of authentication. The use of OTP adds an additional layer of security by requiring the user to provide a unique code along with their biometric data to gain access. This combination offers many advantages, such as reducing the risk of fraud, protecting against identity theft, and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information
In conclusion, iris and fingerprint authentication provide a highly secure and accurate method for verifying user identity, making it a valuable tool for securing data. The combination of both biometric modalities can further enhance the system's performance, and future enhancements can improve the system's security and usability. Overall, iris and fingerprint authentication is a promising technology for protecting against identity theft and securing sensitive data.
